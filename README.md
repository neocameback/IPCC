# AppRTCDemo - Android

##About
This project is a native webrtc prototype in order to communicate with kurentos media server. It works in conjunction with two other projects:

Related projects:
- a pure websocket AppRTC for Kurento: AppRTC-Kurento and
- a pure websocket AppRTC for Android: AppRTC-iOS 

##Documentation
This WebRTC Android App simply connects to a Java Webrtc Signaling Server via Websocket Protokoll and lists connected users which can be called via Videophone. It is a WebRTC ready prototype for integration into other apps which want to implement WebRTC Videocalls e.g. for their Sales and Support team. 

##Installation
1. git clone this repository and open it in Android Studio
2. AppRTC-Kurento (Signaling Server) must be running already
3. STUN-TURN Server should be running, if you run the project outside your local LAN.
4. connect your Android phone via USB and deploy and start android app from Android Studio 
5. in the app settings (top right corner of the running app) 
	- change the Websocket-URL according to the URL of your signaling server 
		e.g. wss://webrtcsignaling-server/jWebrtc (secure websocket - wss:// insecure with ws:// )
		 you can change the default values in  strings.xml  ```<string name="pref_room_server_url_default" translatable="false">wss://nicokrause.com/jWebrtc</string>``
	- enter your favourite username which should register on signaling server and should be visible and reachable by the peers
6. open chrome and/or android browser to https://webrtcsignaling-server/jWebrtc and register another user
7. choose a registered user on phone or browser and call.

##Code-Instructions
- the apps main activities are:
	ConnectActivity - the main screen - displays connected users
	CallActivity - the screen which has the video and their controls

- all websocket communication is done in 
	WebsocketChannelClient - creates, connects, registeres and closes the websocket to SignalingServer 
	WebsocketRTCClient - receives WebRTC - signaling messages and handles them accordingly

- WebRTC peerconnection is done in PeerConnectionClient

##Common Mistakes
- (production) wrong url for webservice.
- (development) smartphone not in same network as browser, media kurento server 
- (development) kurento server not running?

##Todo/Bugs
- remote hangup stops communication very late. stop must react immediately
- (screensharing) remote hangup does not switches back to video screen
- (screensharing) if android calls browser - browse cannot start screensharing (initiater - offer problem) 


#Improvements and Research
- Custom-Dialog for "back to front" enhancement

	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32224452/android-unable-to-add-window-permission-denied-for-this-window-type
- try timeout of half a second ofter bringing app back to foreground for display call dialog
- (enhancement) bring app to forground during incoming call (doesn't work)

	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12074980/bring-application-to-front-after-user-clicks-on-home-button
- re-register when coming back online
- send heartbeat message to websocket 
- (feature) add wake up feature - if (user is offline - allow wake up trough gcm)
- save gcm registration token with websocket registration on signaling server
- wake up certain user when offline (if app was started can be seen if use is online now) 

- security check BEAST attack on production server (TEST SSL) 
	https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=webrtc.a-fk.de&latest
- goes in background - comes back and does not fetch new user list
- Test necessary: don't let android go into idle mode during a call (who can test this in Android 5.0)

##possible tweaks 
- produces echo while communicating with chrome
	- test with non-opus codec
	- Echo Cancellation: Android-AECM https://github.com/lhc180/webrtc-based-android-aecm

##Nice2Have
- (p3) add "audio call" and "video call" button
- (p3) add "answer with audio" and answer "answer with video" button during incoming call 


##Tests
- Handsfree speaker test switch with earpiece 
- (not tested yet) does app go in stand by mode during video broadcast
- (not tested yet) test reconnect when app goes offline or wifi off (see also: https://github.com/palmerc/SecureWebSockets/issues/13)
- (ok) test socket stays connected in background mode.
